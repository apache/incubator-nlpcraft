# This is joint configuration file for both the server and the data probes. Note that
# server and probe configuration can be placed into separate files - each file containing only
# 'nlpcraft.server' or 'nlpcraft.probe' sub-sections.
#
# You can also provide configuration properties or override the default ones via environment variables.
# To use environment variables override:
# 1. Set probe or server JVM system property -Dconfig.override_with_env_vars=true
# 2. For each configuration 'x.y.z' set the environment variable CONFIG_FORCE_x_y_z=some_value
#
# Examples of environment variables:
#   -- Overrides 'nlpcraft.sever.host' configuration property.
#   CONFIG_FORCE_nlpcraft_server_rest_host="localhost"
#
#   -- Overrides 'nlpcraft.sever.models' configuration property.
#   CONFIG_FORCE_nlpcraft_server_models="com.models.MyModel"
#
# See https://nlpcraft.apache.org/server-and-probe.html for more details.

    # Basic NLP toolkit to use on both server and probes. Possible values:

    #
    # NOTE:
    # ----
    # Due to licensing restrictions of the official ASF release policy some of the
    # configuration for NLPCraft cannot be shipped with the official Apache release.
    # Instead, NLPCraft will attempt to download these configuration files from the
    # external URL upon the first start.
    #
    # NLPCraft will attempt to download the missing configuration files from URL defined
    # in 'nlpcraft.extConfig.extUrl' property and place them into 'nlpcraft.extConfig.locDir'
    # folder on the local file system. On subsequent starts, NLPCraft will check if the required
    # file is already present locally and skip the download in such case. If 'nlpcraft.extConfig.checkMd5'
    # property is set to 'true' then on each start NLPCraft will check the checksum of each file
    # locally and remote and will re-download such file if the MD5 checksums don't match.
    #
    # By default, the external configuration is stored in the main Git repository for NLPCraft
    # project from where it will be downloaded ('/external' folder). See this folder in the Git
    # repository for more information: https://github.com/apache/incubator-nlpcraft/raw/external_config/external

        # If 'true', on each start NLPCraft will check the MD5 checksum of the each local and remote
        # external configuration file and will re-download such file if the checksum doesn't match.
        # Set it to 'false' to speed up the bootstrap of the NLPCraft server and the data probe if you
        # are certain that all external configuration files are properly downloaded and available
        # in 'nlpcraft.extConfig.locDir' local folder.
