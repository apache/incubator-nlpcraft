/**
 * This example provides very simple implementation for NLI-powered light switch.
 * You can say something like this:
 *
 *  - "Turn the lights off in the entire house."
 *  - "Switch on the illumination in the master bedroom closet."
 *
 * You can easily modify intent callbacks to perform the actual light switching using
 * HomeKit or Arduino-based controllers.
 *
 * See 'README.md' file in the same folder for running and testing instructions.
