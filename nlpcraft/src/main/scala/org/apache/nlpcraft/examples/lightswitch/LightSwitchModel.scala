  * This example provides very simple implementation for NLI-powered light switch.
  * You can say something like this:
  * <ul>
  *     <li>"Turn the lights off in the entire house."</li>
  *     <li>"Switch on the illumination in the master bedroom closet."</li>
  * </ul>
  * You can easily modify intent callbacks to perform the actual light switching using
  * HomeKit or Arduino-based controllers.
  * <p>
  * See 'README.md' file in the same folder for running and testing instructions.
