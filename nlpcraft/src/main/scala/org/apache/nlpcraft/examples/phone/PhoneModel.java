/**
 * Phone example data model. This example simulates voice phone dialing a-la Siri or Google Assistant.
 * It doesn't actually do a phone dialing but it recognizes the recipient and returns it back. You
 * can easily add access to the a contact database and issue the call via many existing REST services.
 * <p>
 * Note that this example is using NE tokens from Google Natural Language service. 'google' provider should
 * be enabled to run this example - see 'tokenProviders' section in server configuration.
 * Note also that this example is using class-based intent DSL (to demonstrate its usage).
 * <p>
 * See 'README.md' file in the same folder for running and testing instructions.
