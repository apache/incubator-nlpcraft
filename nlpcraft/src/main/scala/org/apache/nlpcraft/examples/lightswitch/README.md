### Light Switch Example
This example provides very simple implementation for NLI-powered light switch. You can say something like `turn the lights off in
the entire house` or `switch on the illumination in the master bedroom closet`. 
You can easily modify intent callbacks to perform the actual light switching using HomeKit or Arduino-based
controllers.

### Documentation
