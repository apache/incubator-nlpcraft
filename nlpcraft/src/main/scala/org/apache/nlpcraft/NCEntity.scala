/**
  * An entity is a collection if one or more {@link NCToken tokens}. An entity typically has a
  * consistent semantic meaning and usually denotes a real-world object, such as persons, locations, number,
  * date and time, organizations, products, etc. - where such objects can be abstract or have a physical existence.
  * Entities are produced by {@link NCEntityParser}. See {@link NCPipeline} for documentation on the entities in the
  * overall processing pipeline.
  *
  * <span class="hdr">Metadata</span>
  * Note that both {@link NCToken} and {@link NCEntity} interfaces extend {@link NCPropertyMap} interface
  * that allows them to store custom metadata properties. Parser, enrichers and validators for tokens
  * and entities use this capability to store and check their properties in tokens and entities.
