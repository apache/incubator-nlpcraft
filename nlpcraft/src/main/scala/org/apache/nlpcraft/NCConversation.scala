/**
  * Conversation container. Conversation is essentially a container for everything that should be implicitly remembered
  * during the active, ongoing conversation and forgotten once the conversation stops. Conversation contains the
  * following elements:
  * <ul>
  * <li>List of entities defining a "short-term-memory (STM)" of this conversation.</li>
  * <li>Chronological list of previously matched intents.</li>
  * <li>Auto-expiring user data.</li>
  * </ul>
  * Note that the conversation is unique for given combination of user and data model.
  * <p>
  * Conversation management is based on idea of a short-term-memory (STM). STM can be viewed as a condensed
  * short-term history of the input for a given user and data model. Every submitted user request that wasn't
  * rejected is added to the conversation STM as a list of tokens. Existing STM tokens belonging to the same
  * group will be overridden by the more recent tokens from the same group. Note also that tokens in STM automatically
  * expire (i.e. context is "forgotten") after a certain period of time and/or based on the depth of the
  * conversation since the last mention.
  * <p>
  * You can also maintain user state-machine between requests using conversation's session. Conversation's {@link # getData ( ) data} is
  * a mutable thread-safe container that can hold any arbitrary user data while supporting the same expiration logic as
  * the rest of the conversation elements (i.e. tokens and previously matched intent IDs).
  * <p>
  * Conversation expiration policy is configured by two configuration properties:
  * <ul>
  * <li>{@link NCModelConfig# getConversationDepth ( )}</li>
  * <li>{@link NCModelConfig# getConversationTimeout ( )}</li>
  * </ul>
  *
  * @see NCContext#getConversation()
  * @see NCModelConfig#getConversationDepth()
  * @see NCModelConfig#getConversationTimeout() */
