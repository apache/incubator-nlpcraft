 * Custom model element parser for programmatic NER implementations. This parser allows to define your own
 * Named Entity Recognizer (NER) implementation in cases when the standard declarative methods are not expressive
 * enough. Instance of the parser should be made available in the model via {@link NCModel#getParsers()} method.
 * <p>
 * By default, the data model detects its elements by their declarative synonyms. However,
 * in some cases this is not expressive enough. In such cases, one or more user-defined parsers can be defined
 * for the model that would allow the user to define its own NER logic to detect the model elements in the user
 * input programmatically. Note that there can be multiple custom parsers per model and each one can detect
 * any number of model elements.
