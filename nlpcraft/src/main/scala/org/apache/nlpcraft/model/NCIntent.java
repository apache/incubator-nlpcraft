/**
 * Annotation to bind an intent with the method serving as its callback. This annotation takes a string value
 * that defines an intent via IDL. This annotation can also be applied to a model's class in
 * which case it will just declare the intent without binding it and the callback method will need to
 * use {@link NCIntentRef} annotation to actually bind it to the declared intent. Note that multiple intents
 * can be bound to the same callback method, but only one callback method can be bound with a given intent.
