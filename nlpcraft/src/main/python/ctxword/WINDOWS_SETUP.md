### Windows Setup
To set up `ctxword` module under Windows, you would need to repeat steps from `src/main/python/ctxword/bin/install_dependencies.sh` script:
 1. Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:
    - `python3`
    - `pip3` (included with the latest versions of python3)
    - `git`
    - `rust` (install from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))
 2. Download pre-trained [FastText](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/vectors-crawl/cc.en.300.bin.gz) model.
 3. Extract GZIP model into `data` folder (i.e. `/nlpcraft/src/main/python/ctxword/data`).
 4. Git clone [FastText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText.git) into some temporary folder.
 5. Ensure that you have [Microsoft Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/) installed. Step 6. will fail unless this SDK is installed.
 6. Run as administrator `pip3 install fastText` (where `fastText` is root of the cloned git repository from the previous step).
 7. Install PyTorch depending on whether you have NVIDIA CUDA support (check the latest 'PyTorch' version):
    - Without CUDA support: `pip3 install torch==1.9.1+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html`
    - With CUDA support: `pip3 install torch==1.9.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html`
 8. Install the rest of required python packages from `bin/py_requirements` by running `pip3 install -r bin/py_requirements`
 9. You can remove the local clone of FastText git repository after its setup is finished.
