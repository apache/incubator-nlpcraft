### Overview
`ctxword` module provides Python-based internal tool for finding a contextually related words for a given word from the
input sentence. This utility provides a single REST endpoint and is based on Google's [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert) 
models and Facebook's [FastText](https://fasttext.cc/) library.

### Dependencies
**Important**: You will need `conda` and Python 3.x

NLPCraft by default, will use the Python [conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
located at `<USER-HOME>/.nlpcraft-python` . 

All dependencies should be automatically installed in the Maven `compile` phase of the lifecycle. To re-install dependencies use:
 * `mvn compile`



 **Windows**: read `nlpcraft\src\main\python\ctxword\bin\WINDOWS_SETUP.md` file for manual installation.

### Start REST Server
To start 'ctxword' module REST server:
 * `$ cd nlpcraft/src/main/python/ctxword`
 * `$ bin/start_server.{sh|cmd}` 


##### IMPORTANT

Please change the following line in the `bin/start_server.{sh|cmd}` file above to the path of your `conda.sh` file.

By default, it points to `~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh`

Line you need to change:

`source <enter-your-path>/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh`

*'miniconda' is for example purposes. This could be in your 'anaconda folder (if you use anaconda instead of miniconda).*

 
NOTE: On the first start the server will try to load compressed BERT model which is not yet available. It will
then download this library and compress it which will take a several minutes and may require 10 GB+ of 
available memory. Subsequent starts will skip this step, and the server will start much faster.

### REST API
Once the REST server starts you can issue REST calls to get suggestions for the contextual related words.
REST server provides a single `application/json` endpoint:
 
##### `api/v1/ctxserver/suggestions` (POST)
Returns contextual word replacement(s) for the specified word in the input sentence. Accepts JSON object parameter 
with the following fields:
 * `"sentences"`
   - List of sentences. Each sentence encoded as object with the following fields:
     - `"text"` represents the sentence text.
     - `"indexes"` array of positions in the sentence of the words to generate suggestions for.  
 * `"simple"` 
   - Optional, defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, returns simple objects. If set to `false` returns
   expanded objects with total, BERT and fasttext scores.  
 * `"limit"` 
   - Optional, defaults to 10. Sets limit of result words number. 
 * `"min_score"` 
   - Optional, defaults to 0. Sets the minimal requirement for total score.
 * `"min_ftext"` 
   - Optional, default to 0.25. Sets the minimal requirement of FastText score.  
*  `"min_bert"` 
   - Optional, default to 0. Sets the minimal requirement of Bert score.
     
Endpoint returns one or more JSON objects with the following fields (depending on `"simple"` request field):
 * If `"simple"` set to `true`: `[word1, word2, ...]`
 * If `"simple"` set to `false`:`[{word1, total_score1, ft_score1, bert_score1}, {...}]`

#### Examples
Here's the sample request and response JSON objects:
 * Request JSON: 
   - ``"simple": true, "sentences": [{"text": "foo bar baz", "indexes": [0, 2]}, {"text": "sample second sentence", indexes:[1]}]``
 * Response JSON:
   - `[["word1", "word2", "word3"]]`
 
### `suggest.{sh|cmd}`
You can use Curl-based `nlpcraft/src/main/python/ctxword/bin/suggest.{sh|cmd}` scripts for the suggestion processing of single sentences from the command line.
Following call returns list of contextual suggestions for the 5th word (counting from zero) in the given sentence: 

```
$ bin/suggest.sh "what is the chance of rain tomorrow?" 5
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   214  100   104  100   110    954   1009 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  1963
[
    [
        "rain",
        "snow",
        "rainfall",
        "precipitation",
        "rains",
        "flooding",
        "storms",
        "raining",
        "sunshine",
        "showers"
    ]
]
```
